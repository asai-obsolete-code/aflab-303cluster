"run.sh" and "lama.sh" is a sample script for templating many qsub request.

: ./qsub-template.sh -r "-P 4 -t 1800 -T 3600 -m 2000000 -M 8000000" lama.sh

+ "run.sh" calls qsub-template.sh. In run.sh, list the template files and
  resource iteration boundary.
  + here, iteration boundary is specified by -r option, and lama.sh is the
    qsub generation script.
+ qsub-template.sh calls lama.sh iterating over pddl problem files starting
  with "pXX" in all the subdirectories.
+ lama.sh is actually a thin wrapper that calls shared-template.sh in turn,
  which is the true generation script.
