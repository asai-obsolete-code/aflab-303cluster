This repository contains a set of convenient maintainance scripts for
aflab-303 clusters. Use it on funlucy.

Usage:

+ =map [-s passwd] [-p] [-l] [-- SSH_OPTIONS --] COMMAND...= :: run COMMAND on each fun node. During
     the execution, PWD is set to the host's current directory. It assumes the
     nfs file system is already mounted.
   + If -p is given, they run in parallel.
   + If -l|--funlucy is given, add funlucy into the mapped hosts.
   + If --profile is given, profile the command with bash =time=.
   + If -s passwd is given, COMMAND is wrapped by sudo.
   + if =SSH_OPTIONS= are provided between =--='s, they are passed to =ssh= (8).
   + =hosts= contains a list of hostnames to be logged in by =map=.
     Lines after =#= are treated as comments.
+ watch  :: watch the number of jobs running. quit with C-c
+ ps-all :: for each fun node, shows the several processes that are using the
            largest amount of memory
+ qhold-all.sh [regexp] :: hold all jobs whose job names / user names
     match the regexp
+ test-connection.sh :: This script logs in to each fun node X, and then try
     to connect to the other node Y. Thus, running this script can detect
     the error in the connection between X and Y for all pairs (X, Y).
