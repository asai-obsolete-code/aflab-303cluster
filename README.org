This repository contains a set of convenient maintainance scripts for
aflab-303 clusters. Use it on funlucy.

Usage:

+ =map [-s passwd] [-p] [-- SSH_OPTIONS --] COMMAND...= :: run COMMAND on each fun node. During
     the execution, PWD is set to the host's current directory. It assumes the
     nfs file system is already mounted.
   + If -p is given, they run in parallel.
   + If -s passwd is given, COMMAND is wrapped by sudo.
   + =hosts= contains a list of hostnames to be logged in by the invocation
     of =map=. Lines after =#= are considered the comments.
+ watch  :: watch the number of jobs running. quit with C-c
+ ps-all :: for each fun node, shows the top processes that are using the memory the most
+ qhold-all.sh [regexp] :: hold everything whose job name / user name
   matches the regexp
+ test-connection.sh :: This script logs in to each fun node X, and then try
     to connect to the other node Y. Thus, running this script can detect
     the error in the connection between X and Y for all pairs (X, Y).
